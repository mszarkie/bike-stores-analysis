# Welcome! 
I'm glad you're here ðŸ¥‡ This project is dedicated to showcasing my skills in writing T-SQL queries and creating reports in Power BI.
## SQL Queries

I've utilized various techniques in my queries, including:

* Predicates
  
Functions that i've used:

* CASE
*  RANK()
* SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), ROUND(), FLOOR()
* CONCAT(), FORMAT(), LEFT(), TRIM(), CHARINDEX(), LOWER(), CONVERT()
* DATEDIFF(), GETDATE(), YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY()
* ISNULL(), IIF()
* DISTINCT()

In the "Power BI" folder, you'll find screen of report that I have made and source file.
