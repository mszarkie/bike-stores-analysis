# Welcome! 
I'm glad you're here ðŸ¥‡ This project is dedicated to showcasing my skills in writing T-SQL queries and creating reports in Power BI.
## SQL Queries
In the "SQL queries" folder, you'll find queries categorized accordingly.
<br>
<br>
I've utilized various techniques in my queries, including:
<br>
* Common Table Expressions (CTE)
* Window Rank Functions
* Subqueries
* JOIN family
  
 Some of the functions I've used include:

* RANK()
* SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX()
* CONCAT(), FORMAT()
* DATEDIFF(), YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY()
* LOWER()

## Data to Download
In the "Downloads" folder, you'll find the data that I analyzed.

#### I'm flexible and can adapt to different project requirements. I'm also comfortable consulting documentation to utilize even more functions as needed ðŸ‘€
